# Basic Python Syntax

We will start coding by exploring basic Python syntax. First, go through the video lessons, then do some interactive tutorials.

## Video Lessons

Go through *one* or more of these to get started with basic Python syntax. They are mostly equivalent, but the are 
arranged in order from slowest, most detailed (beginner), too fastest, less detailed (intermediate).

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - Sections 3, 4, and 5
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - Section 4
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) - Section 2

## Interactive Tutorials

These two free courses offer browser-based environments with guided, interactive, hands-on tutorials for learning Python. 
Try both of these. Just do section 1 of each course for now. The three courses are listed in order from beginner to 
intermediate skill levels. (Some offer some introductory video instruction with the guided tutorials. Watch these videos too.)

* [Code School: Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) - Level 1
* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - 1 Python Syntax
* [Datacamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) - 1 Python Basics

You may also wish to run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python or Jupyter Notebook if you have 
additional time and interest.
