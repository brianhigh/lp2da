# Basic Python Syntax

In this module we will start coding in Python. First, go through the video 
lessons to learn basic Python syntax, then work through some interactive, 
online tutorials for practice.

In particular, we will start with basic statements like print and assignment
statements. We will look at variables and the main data types in Python.
We will also learn about data structures, such as lists and dictionaries.

## Video lessons

Go through *one* or more of these to get started with basic Python syntax. 
They are mostly equivalent, but they are listed in order from slowest, most 
detailed (beginner), to the fastest, least detailed (intermediate).

  Section 4: Python Crash Course "Data Types" -- which is Part I and II (up 7:12)
* [Udemy: Python A-Z™: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!](https://www.udemy.com/python-coding) - 
  Section 2 (at least videos 2-4, with more detail in Section 3)
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/419162-2.html) (*free through [SPL](http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org)*) - 
  Section 2
* [edX: Using Python for Research (Harvard)](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-research-harvardx-ph526x) (*free* to audit) - 
  Week 1, Parts 1 and 2
  
NOTE: The first course in the list above, *Complete Python Bootcamp* is based 
on Python 2.7 *not* Python 3. We will use Python 3. You can still watch videos 
made for Python 2.7, just note the differences. These are pointed out by the 
instructor, so just be mindful.

NOTE: If you are beginner to programming, and even *Complete Python Bootcamp* 
is going too fast for you, then you are encouraged to first take these courses ...

* Course I and II from the [Coursera: Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

... before proceeding with our course (*Learning Python for Data Analysis*, 
"lp4da").

## Interactive tutorials

These free courses offer browser-based environments with online, guided, 
interactive tutorials for learning Python. Try all of these courses if you 
have the time and interest. Otherwise, try at least one of the courses. Just 
do section 1 of each course you choose to try. 

The three courses are listed in increasing skill level -- from absolute beginner 
to intermediate. Some of these courses include short introductory videos along 
with the interactive tutorials. So, as the videos appear, watch them before 
proceeding to complete the exercises that they introduce.

* [Code School: Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) (*free with registration*) - 
  Level 1: Birds & Coconuts
* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) (*free with registration*) - 
  1: Python Syntax
* [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) (*free with registration*) - 
  1: Python Basics

You may also wish to run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python 
(python, ipython, or spyder) or Jupyter Notebook if you have additional time 
and interest.

## Reading

All reading in this course is optional. Who has the time or attention span 
these days? Well, if you do, here are some worthy assignments. Pick one. As 
before, the assignments are listed from beginner to intermediate skill level 
(or programming background, experience, etc.). These are also listed from 
least verbose to most verbose.

* [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython003.html) (*free online*) - 
  Ch. 2
* [Introducing Python (2014)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098624030_introducing_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Ch. 2 and 3
* [Learning Python, 5th Ed. (2013)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098595030_learning_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Ch. 4 (more detail in Ch. 5 - 9)

NOTE: The second book listed above is probably the best match for this 
portion of our course. 

### Additional materials

#### Courses

A key component of Python for Data Analysis is the *Pandas* library. We will 
not get to this material until later in our course. However, if you are signing
up for online materials for our course now, and there is a time-limited discount
offer currently running, you may want to sign up for this Udemy course now,
while you can still take advantage of the discounted costs, as they can be 
significant.

* [Udemy: Data Analysis in Python with Pandas](https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-in-python-with-pandas/)

NOTE: This course is a few years old now and was taught using Python 2.7.

This course covers more than *Pandas*, and the instructor does a good job
explaining and demonstrating the various concepts along the way. It provides
an alternative presentation to the first third of the material covered in 
*Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp*. It covers all of
the material in *Python A-Z™: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!* 
except for the "Advanced Visualization" section, but with more focus on *Pandas*.

*edX* also offers Python courses. Here are a few that might interest you:

* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (MIT)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9)
* [Introduction to Python for Data Science (Microsoft/DataCamp)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-python-data-science-microsoft-dat208x-4)
* [Using Python for Research (Harvard)](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-research-harvardx-ph526x)

You can take them for free. Some are self-paced, while others have a fixed schedule.

#### Books

Later, we will also refer to some books specifically intended for learning how 
to use Python for data analysis. We mention these now, in case you wanted to 
plan your library loans or book purchases ahead of time.

* [Data Wrangling With Python (2016)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3239443030_data_wrangling_with_python) (free access through *SPL*)
* [Python for Data Analysis (2013)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098569030_python_for_data_analysis) (free from *SPL*)

These two books, combined with *Introducing Python* would make an ideal set
of texts for our course. So, if you are truly serious about learning this 
material, and would actually read these books, then you are encouraged to 
obtain a copy of each of them and study them carefully.

For a more recent (2016) treatment of IPython, Numpy and Pandas, see:

* [Python Data Science Handbook (2016)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3251526030_python_data_science_handbook) (free access through *SPL*)

Note: This book presents the material in more of a cookbook fashion than 
*Python for Data Analysis*. Code examples are used to show the concepts with 
only a minimum of explanatory text.
