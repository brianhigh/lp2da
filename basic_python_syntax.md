# Basic Python Syntax

In this module we will start coding in Python. First, go through the video 
lessons to learn basic Python syntax, then work through some interactive, 
online tutorials for practice.

## Video Lessons

Go through *one* or more of these to get started with basic Python syntax. 
They are mostly equivalent, but they are listed in order from slowest, most 
detailed (beginner), to the fastest, least detailed (intermediate).

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 3, 4, and 5
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - 
  Section 4
* [Udemy: Python A-Zâ„¢: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!](https://www.udemy.com/python-coding) - 
  Section 2 (at least videos 2-4, with more detail in Section 3)
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) (*free through [SPL](http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org)*) - 
  Section 2
  
  NOTE: The first course in the list above is based on Python 2.7 *not* Python 3. 
  We will use Python 3. You can still watch videos made for Python 2.7, just note
  the differences. These are pointed out by the instructor, so just be mindful.

## Interactive Tutorials

These free courses offer browser-based environments with online, guided, 
interactive tutorials for learning Python. Try all of these courses if you 
have the time and interest. Otherwise, try at least one of the courses. Just 
do section 1 of each course you choose to try. The three courses are listed in 
increasing skill level -- from absolute beginner to intermediate. Some of 
these courses include short introductory videos along with the interactive 
tutorials. So, as the videos appear, watch them before proceeding to complete 
the exercises that they introduce.

* [Code School: Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) (*free with registration*) - 
  Level 1: Birds & Coconuts
* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) (*free with registration*) - 
  1: Python Syntax
* [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) (*free with registration*) - 
  1: Python Basics

You may also wish to run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python 
(python, ipython, or spyder) or Jupyter Notebook if you have additional time 
and interest.

## Reading

All reading in this course is optional. Who has the time or attention span 
these days? Well, if you do, here are some worthy assignments. Pick one. As 
before, the assignments are listed from beginner to intermediate skill level 
(or programming background, experience, etc.). These are also listed from 
least verbose to most verbose.

* [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython003.html) (*free online*) - 
  Ch. 2
* [Introducing Python (2014)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098624030_introducing_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Ch. 2 and 3
* [Learning Python, 5th Ed. (2013)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098595030_learning_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Ch. 4 (more detail in Ch. 5 - 9)

NOTE: The second book listed above is probably the best match for this 
portion of our course. 

Later, we will also refer to some books specifically intended for learning how 
to use Python for data analysis.

* [Data Wrangling With Python (2016)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3239443030_data_wrangling_with_python) (free access through *SPL*)
* [Python for Data Analysis (2013)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098569030_python_for_data_analysis) (free from *SPL*)

These two books, combined with *Introducing Python* would make an ideal set
of texts for our course.
