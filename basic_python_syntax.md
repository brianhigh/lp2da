# Basic Python Syntax

In this module we will start coding in Python. First, go through the video lessons to learn basic Python syntax, then work 
through some interactive, online tutorials for practice.

## Video Lessons

Go through *one* or more of these to get started with basic Python syntax. They are mostly equivalent, but the are 
arranged in order from slowest, most detailed (beginner), too fastest, least detailed (intermediate).

* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - Section 4
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) - Section 2

## Interactive Tutorials

These free courses offer browser-based environments with online, guided, interactive tutorials for learning Python. 
Try all of these courses if you have the time and interest. Otherwise, try at least one of the courses. Just do section 1 of each 
course you choose to try. The three courses are listed in increasing skill level -- from absolute beginner to intermediate. Some of 
these courses include short introductory videos along with the interactive tutorials. So, as the videos appear, watch them before 
proceeding to complete the exercises that they introduce.

* [Code School: Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) - Level 1: Birds & Coconuts
* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - 1: Python Syntax
* [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) - 1: Python Basics

You may also wish to run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python or Jupyter Notebook if you have 
additional time and interest.

## Reading

All reading in this course is optional. Who has the time or attention span these days? Well, if you do, here are 
some worthy assignments. Pick one. As before, the assignments are listed from beginner to intermediate skill level 
(or programming background, experience, etc.). These are also listed from less verbose to most verbose.
