# Getting Started

We will start by getting an introduction to Python and installing Python on your own computer.

## Installing Python

Here are the relavent courses and sections. Go through *one* or more of these to get started. They are all mostly equivalent.

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - Sections 1 and 2
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - Sections 1, 2, and 3
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) - Section 1

When installing software, install [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloada) (latest version). It will include Jupyter Notebook and Spyder.

## Interactive Tutorials

These two free courses offer browser-based environments with guided, interactive, hands-on tutorials for learning Python. 
Try both of these. Just do section 1 of each course for now. Later we will continue with these courses. You may also wish to
run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python or Jupyter Notebook if you have additional time and interest.

* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - 1 Python Syntax
* [Datacamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) - 1 Python Basics
