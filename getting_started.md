# Getting started

Learning Python for Data Analysis (lp4da) is a course useful for self-guided study, 
study groups, private tutoring. It can also provide a structure for traditional 
classroom instruction.

This course will use materials from online courses, websites, software, and books. 
The materials have been selected to suit a variety of student backgrounds. The
software is free, open-source, and will run on Windows, Mac, or Linux computers.

For each learning module, we will provide a list of materials and assignments. You
can select the materials which best suit your background (level of expertise and
degree of interest).

We will start with a basic introduction to Python and then proceed to install 
Python onto your own computer.

## Installing Python

Here are the relevant courses and sections. Go through *one* or more of these 
to get started. They are all mostly equivalent, but they are listed in order 
of *decreasing* detail (and video duration). 

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 1 and 2
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 1, 2, and 3
* [Udemy: Python A-Zâ„¢: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!](https://www.udemy.com/python-coding) - 
  Section 1 (video 1)
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) (*free through [SPL](http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org)*) - 
  Section 1

When installing software, install [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloada) 
(latest version). Anaconda will include Jupyter Notebook and Spyder. This is 
all free software.

NOTE: The first course in the list above is based on Python 2.7 *not* Python 3. 
We will use Python 3.
