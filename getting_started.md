# Getting Started

We will start by getting an introduction to Python and installing Python on your own computer.

## Installing Python

Here are the relavent courses and sections. Go through *one* or more of these to get started. They are all mostly equivalent.

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - Sections 1 and 2
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - Sections 1, 2, and 3
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) - Section 1

When installing software, install [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloada) (latest version). It will include Jupyter Notebook and Spyder.
