# Getting Started

We will start by getting an introduction to Python and installing Python on 
your own computer.

## Installing Python

Here are the relevant courses and sections. Go through *one* or more of these 
to get started. They are all mostly equivalent, but they are listed in order 
of *decreasing* detail (and video duration). 

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 1 and 2
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 1, 2, and 3
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/) (*free through [SPL](http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org)*) - 
  Section 1

When installing software, install [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloada) 
(latest version). Anaconda will include Jupyter Notebook and Spyder. This is 
all free software.

NOTE: The first course in the list above is based on Python 2.7 *not* Python 3.
