# Basic Python Syntax II

This module is devoted to rounding out your basic introduction to Python
language syntax with material covering comparison operators, conditional 
statements, loops, and functions.

## Video lessons

Go through *one* or more of these to continue learning basic Python syntax. 
They are mostly equivalent, but they are listed in order from slowest, most 
detailed (beginner), to the fastest, least detailed (intermediate).

* [Udemy: Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) - 
  Sections 4, 5, and 6
* [Udemy: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - 
  Finish Section 4: Python Crash Course
* [Udemy: Python A-Zâ„¢: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!](https://www.udemy.com/python-coding) - 
  Finish Section 2 and Section 3, videos 11-16 (up through "Functions in Python")
* [Lynda: Introduction to Data Analysis with Python](https://www.lynda.com/Numpy-tutorials/Introduction-Data-Analysis-Python/419162-2.html) (*free through [SPL](http://lynda.com/portal/sip?org=spl.org)*) - 
  Section 3: Word Anagrams in Python (this is a project-based tutorial)
  
NOTE: The first course in the list above, *Complete Python Bootcamp* is based 
on Python 2.7 *not* Python 3. We will use Python 3. You can still watch videos 
made for Python 2.7, just note the differences. These are pointed out by the 
instructor, so just be mindful.

## Interactive tutorials

The three courses are listed in increasing skill level -- from absolute beginner 
to intermediate. Some of these courses include short introductory videos along 
with the interactive tutorials. So, as the videos appear, watch them before 
proceeding to complete the exercises that they introduce.

* [Code School: Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) (*free with registration*) - 
  Levels 2 and 3 (complete the course)
* [Codecademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) (*free with registration*) - 
  Sections 2 through 8
* [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/) (*free with registration*) - 
  Section 2 through Section 3: List Methods 1 and 2 (stop before you get to Packages)

You may also wish to run the commands from these tutorials in Anaconda Python 
(python, ipython, or spyder) or Jupyter Notebook if you have additional time 
and interest.

## Reading

All reading in this course is optional. Who has the time or attention span 
these days? Well, if you do, here are some worthy assignments. Pick one. As 
before, the assignments are listed from beginner to intermediate skill level 
(or programming background, experience, etc.). These are also listed from 
least verbose to most verbose.

* [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython004.html) (*free online*) - 
  Ch. 3
* [Introducing Python (2014)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098624030_introducing_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Ch. 4
* [Learning Python, 5th Ed. (2013)](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/3098595030_learning_python) (free from *SPL*) - 
   Chapters 10-13 and 16-18

NOTE: The second book listed above is probably the best match for this 
portion of our course.
