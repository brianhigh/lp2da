Learning Python for Data Analysis (lp4da)

This repository contains materials for a self-guided course.

The course provides a structure for learning the Python programming language for use in data analysis.

## A "meta" course

Our course structure will actually guide you through several popular online courses. 
The combination of these courses will allow you to become proficient in using Python for data 
analysis, even if you have no previous programming experience.

## Learning modules

1. [Getting Started](getting_started.md): Installing Python and Jupyter (IPython) Notebook
2. [Basic Python Syntax I](basic_python_syntax.md): Data Types, Operators, Variables, and Data Structures
3. [Basic Python Syntax II](basic_python_syntax_2.md): Comparison Operators, Conditional Statements, Loops, and Functions
